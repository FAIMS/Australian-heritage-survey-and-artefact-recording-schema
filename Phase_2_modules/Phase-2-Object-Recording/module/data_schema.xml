        <term>{Chalcedony}
<description>Hard, fine grained material composed of very small silica crystals, highly variable in colour. Unlike chert, chalcedony has a fibrous structure with fine intergrowths of quartz and often has a waxy lustre and is often semi-transparent or translucent</description></term>

<description>Hard, non-foliated rock derived from quartz sandstone and metamorphosed, varying in colour depending on presence of other minerals, but typically white, grey, pink or red due to iron oxides.

<description>Very fine grained sedimentary rock, but unlike mudstones, is prone to lamination</description></term>
        <term>{Silcrete__general}
<description>Hard, resistant material that can appear simiilar to quartzite but results from the dissolution of silica and its resolidification as a cement, along with other detrital materials. As a result, silcrete has a highly variable grain size but grains are usually evident and, unlike quartzite, fractures will break around grain boundaries. If confident in classification, please select specific silcrete type</description></term>

<description>Very long, low, narrow, nearly level, sinuous ridge immediately adjacent to a stream channel, built up by overbank flow. Levees are built, usually in pairs bounding the two sides of a stream channel, at the level reached by frequent floods. This element is part of a covered plain landform pattern. For an artificial levee, use Embankment. See also Prior stream.</description></term><term>{Ox_bow}
<description>Long, curved, commonly water-filled closed depression eroded by channelled stream flow but closed as a result of aggradation by channelled or overbank stream flow during the formation of a meander plain landform pattern. The floor of an ox-bow may be more or less aggraded by overbank stream flow, wind, and biological (peat) accumulation.</description></term><term>{Prior_stream}

<description>Large flat resulting from aggradation by channelled stream flow as a stream migrates from side to side; the dominant element of a meander plain landform pattern. This landform element may include occurrences of scroll, swale and ox-bow.</description></term><term>{Stream_bed}
<description>linear, generally sinuous open depression forming the bottom of a stream channel, eroded and locally excavated, aggraded or built up by channelled stream flow. Parts that are built up include bars.</description></term><term>{Stream_channel}
