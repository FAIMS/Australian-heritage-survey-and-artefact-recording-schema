<opts>
    <opt>Geomorphic feature extent
        <desc>Cultural deposits are exposed only across a specific geomorphic feature, with artefact density dropping significantly beyond the geomorphic feature boundary</desc>
    </opt>
    <opt>Mound margins
        <desc>Mound margins, demarcated by a visible increase in mound height in relation to adjacent substrate</desc>
    </opt>
    <opt>Reduction in artefact density
        <desc>Exposure of cultural materials is not constrained by the extent of a geomorphic feature, and thus the feature boundary reflects the real distribution of artefacts observed. Site boundary represents a significant decline in artefact numbers.</desc>
    </opt>
    <opt>Extent of built feature
        <desc>Recorded boundary reflects the extent of a built feature (e.g. fenced area, structural foundations)</desc>
    </opt>
    <opt>Not recorded
        <desc>No boundary recording was conducted due to the feature having a constrained extent (e.g. isolated artefact)</desc>
    </opt>
    <opt>Not applicable
        <desc>No boundary recording was conducted. Please specify why in annotation field</desc>
