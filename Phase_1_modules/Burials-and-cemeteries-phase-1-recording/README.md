# Phase 1 Module: Burials and cemeteries

_This module represents a digital workflow recording Burials and Cemeteries. It is designed to support Phase 1 recording of both isolated and larger burials or cemeteries, regardless of cultural or ethnic associations, and whether it is pre- or post-colonial in age._

## Screenshots of the 2020 version:

_In 2020 module was updated to better correspond with in-field requirements of the team in recording of burials and cemeteries. Some issues with usability have also been addressed, and input from colleagues has been incorporated)_
