       _S_e_d  is  a  stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits
       scripted edits (such as _e_d), _s_e_d works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is _s_e_d's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distin‐
       guishes it from other types of editors.

       This is just a brief synopsis of _s_e_d commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know _s_e_d; other documentation (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.

   ZZeerroo--aaddddrreessss ````ccoommmmaannddss''''
       : _l_a_b_e_l
              Label for bb and tt commands.

       #_c_o_m_m_e_n_t
              The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of a --ee script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   ZZeerroo-- oorr OOnnee-- aaddddrreessss ccoommmmaannddss
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       _t_e_x_t   Append _t_e_x_t, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       i \

       _t_e_x_t   Insert _t_e_x_t, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       q [_e_x_i_t_-_c_o_d_e]
              Immediately quit the _s_e_d script without processing any more input, except that if auto-print is not disabled the current pattern space will be printed.  The exit code argument is a GNU exten‐
              sion.

       Q [_e_x_i_t_-_c_o_d_e]
              Immediately quit the _s_e_d script without processing any more input.  This is a GNU extension.

       r _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Append text read from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

       R _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Append a line read from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  Each invocation of the command reads a line from the file.  This is a GNU extension.

       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).

       b _l_a_b_e_l
              Branch to _l_a_b_e_l; if _l_a_b_e_l is omitted, branch to end of script.

       c \

       _t_e_x_t   Replace the selected lines with _t_e_x_t, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      If pattern space contains no newline, start a normal new cycle as if the d command was issued.  Otherwise, delete text in the pattern space up to the first newline, and restart cycle with the
              resultant pattern space, without reading a new line of input.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.

       l _w_i_d_t_h
              List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form, breaking it at _w_i_d_t_h characters.  This is a GNU extension.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the current pattern space.

       s/_r_e_g_e_x_p/_r_e_p_l_a_c_e_m_e_n_t/
              Attempt to match _r_e_g_e_x_p against the pattern space.  If successful, replace that portion matched with _r_e_p_l_a_c_e_m_e_n_t.  The _r_e_p_l_a_c_e_m_e_n_t may contain the special character && to refer to that portion
              of the pattern space which matched, and the special escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the corresponding matching sub-expressions in the _r_e_g_e_x_p.

       t _l_a_b_e_l
              If a s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last t or T command, then branch to _l_a_b_e_l; if _l_a_b_e_l is omitted, branch to end of script.

       T _l_a_b_e_l
              If  no  s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last t or T command, then branch to _l_a_b_e_l; if _l_a_b_e_l is omitted, branch to end of script.  This
              is a GNU extension.

       w _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Write the current pattern space to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

       W _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Write the first line of the current pattern space to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  This is a GNU extension.

       x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

       y/_s_o_u_r_c_e/_d_e_s_t/
              Transliterate the characters in the pattern space which appear in _s_o_u_r_c_e to the corresponding character in _d_e_s_t.

AAddddrreesssseess
       _S_e_d commands can be given with no addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input lines; with one address, in which case the command will only be executed for input  lines  which
       match  that  address; or with two addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input lines which match the inclusive range of lines starting from the first address and continuing to
       the second address.  Three things to note about address ranges: the syntax is _a_d_d_r_1,_a_d_d_r_2 (i.e., the addresses are separated by a comma); the line which _a_d_d_r_1 matched will always be  accepted,  even
       if _a_d_d_r_2 selects an earlier line; and if _a_d_d_r_2 is a _r_e_g_e_x_p, it will not be tested against the line that _a_d_d_r_1 matched.

       After the address (or address-range), and before the command, a !!  may be inserted, which specifies that the command shall only be executed if the address (or address-range) does nnoott match.

       The following address types are supported:

       _n_u_m_b_e_r Match only the specified line _n_u_m_b_e_r (which increments cumulatively across files, unless the --ss option is specified on the command line).

       _f_i_r_s_t~_s_t_e_p
              Match  every  _s_t_e_p'th  line starting with line _f_i_r_s_t.  For example, ``sed -n 1~2p'' will print all the odd-numbered lines in the input stream, and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line,
              starting with the second.  _f_i_r_s_t can be zero; in this case, _s_e_d operates as if it were equal to _s_t_e_p.  (This is an extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /_r_e_g_e_x_p/
              Match lines matching the regular expression _r_e_g_e_x_p.  Matching is performed on the current pattern space, which can be modified with commands such as ``s///''.

       \cc_r_e_g_e_x_pcc
              Match lines matching the regular expression _r_e_g_e_x_p.  The cc may be any character.

       GNU _s_e_d also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,_a_d_d_r_2
              Start out in "matched first address" state, until _a_d_d_r_2 is found.  This is similar to 1,_a_d_d_r_2, except that if _a_d_d_r_2 matches the very first line of input the 0,_a_d_d_r_2 form will be at the end of
              its range, whereas the 1,_a_d_d_r_2 form will still be at the beginning of its range.  This works only when _a_d_d_r_2 is a regular expression.

       _a_d_d_r_1,+_N
              Will match _a_d_d_r_1 and the _N lines following _a_d_d_r_1.

       _a_d_d_r_1,~_N
              Will match _a_d_d_r_1 and the lines following _a_d_d_r_1 until the next line whose input line number is a multiple of _N.

RREEGGUULLAARR EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS
       POSIX.2  BREs  _s_h_o_u_l_d  be supported, but they aren't completely because of performance problems.  The \\nn sequence in a regular expression matches the newline character, and similarly for \\aa, \\tt, and
       other sequences.  The _-_E option switches to using extended regular expressions instead; it has been supported for years by GNU sed, and is now included in POSIX.
