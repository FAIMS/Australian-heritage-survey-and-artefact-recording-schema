<description>Level (less than 1% slope) to very gently inclined, complex landform pattern of extremely low relief. The rapidly migrating alluvial stream channels are shallow to moderately deep, locally numerous, but elsewhere widely spaced. The channels form a centrifugal to divergent, integrated, reticulated to distributary pattern. The landform pattern includes areas that are bar plains, being aggraded or eroded by frequently active channelled stream flow, and other areas comprising terraces or stagnant alluvial plains with slopes that are greater than usual, formed by channelled stream flow but now relict. Incision in the upslope area may give rise to an erosional stream bed between scarps. Typical elements: stream bed, bar, plain. Compare with Sheet-flood fan and Pediment</description></term>

<description>Level landform pattern with extremely low relief. The shallow to deep alluvial stream channels are sparse to widely spaced, forming a unidirectional, integrated network. There may be frequently active erosion and aggradation by channelled and overbank stream flow, or the landforms may be relict from these processes. Typical elements: stream channel (stream bed and bank), plain (dominant). Common elements: bar, scroll, levee, backplain, swamp. Occasional elements: ox-bow, flood-out, lake. Included types of landform pattern are: flood plain, bar plain, meander plain, covered plain, anastomotic plain, delta, stagnant alluvial plain, terrace, terraced land.</description></term>

Compare with other types under Alluvial plain and Flood plain.</description></term>
        <term>{Badlands}
<description>Landform pattern of low to extremely low relief (less than 90 m) and steep to precipitous slopes, typically with numerous fixed, erosional stream channels which form a non-directional, integrated tributary network. There is continuously active erosion by collapse, landslide, sheet flow, creep and channelled stream flow. Typical elements: ridge (dominant), stream bed or gully. Occasional elements: summit surface, hillcrest, hillslope, talus. Compare with Mountains, Hills, Low hills, Rises and Plain</description></term>

<description>Level to gently undulating landform pattern of extremely low relief on which stream channels are very rare.

        <term>{Delta}
<description>Flood plain projecting into a sea or lake, with slowly migrating, deep alluvial channels, usually moderately spaced, typically forming a divergent, integrated distributary network. This landform is aggraded by frequently active overbank and channelled stream flow that is modified by tides. Typical elements: stream channel (stream bed and bank), levee, backplain (co-dominant), swamp (co-·dominant), lagoon (co-dominant). Common elements: beach ridge, swale, beach, estuary, tidal creek.

        <term>{Chalcedony}
<description>Hard, fine grained material composed of very small silica crystals, highly variable in colour. Unlike chert, chalcedony has a fibrous structure with fine intergrowths of quartz and often has a waxy lustre and is often semi-transparent or translucent</description></term>

        <term>{Quartz__milky}
<description>White or milky-coloured material composed of silica, but lacks transparency of clear quartz</description></term>
        <term>{Quartzite}
<description>Hard, non-foliated rock derived from quartz sandstone and metamorphosed, varying in colour depending on presence of other minerals, but typically white, grey, pink or red due to iron oxides. Quartz grains are cemented together to such an extent that fractures break through grain boundaries, rather than around them. Grainy or glassy appearance, but often excellent flaking properties</description></term>
        <term>{Sandstone}
<description>A clastic sedimentary rock, typically of sand-sized mineral particles or rock fragments, often quartz and feldspar</description></term>

<description>Very fine grained sedimentary rock, but unlike mudstones, is prone to lamination</description></term>
        <term>{Silcrete__general}
<description>Hard, resistant material that can appear simiilar to quartzite but results from the dissolution of silica and its resolidification as a cement, along with other detrital materials. As a result, silcrete has a highly variable grain size but grains are usually evident and, unlike quartzite, fractures will break around grain boundaries. If confident in classification, please select specific silcrete type</description></term>

The landform pattern includes areas that are bar plains, being aggraded or eroded by frequently active channelled stream flow, and other areas comprising terraces or stagnant alluvial plains with slopes that are greater than usual, formed by channelled stream flow but now relict.

Common elements: beach, cliff. Occasional elements: rock platform, berm. Compare with Playa plain.</description></term>
        <term>{Longitudinal_dunefield}
<description>Dunefield characterised by long, narrow sand dunes and wide, flat swales.

        <term>{Low_hills}
<description>Landform pattern of low relief (30-90 m) and gentle to very steep slopes, typically with fixed, erosional stream channels, closely to very widely spaced, which form a non-directional or convergent, integrated tributary pattern.

        <term>{Parabolic_dunefield}
<description>Dunefield characterised by sand dunes with a long, scoop-shaped form, convex in the downwind direction so that its trailing arms point upwind; the ground plan, when developed, approximates the form of a parabola.

Compare with Longitudinal dunefield.</description></term>
        <term>{Pediment}
<description>Gently inclined to level (less than 1%) landform pattern of extremely low relief, typically with numerous rapidly migrating, very shallow incipient stream channels, which form a centrifugal to diverging, integrated reticulated pattern.

Compare with Sheet-flood fan and Alluvial fan</description></term>
        <term>{Pediplain}

<description>Hard, non-foliated rock derived from quartz sandstone and metamorphosed, varying in colour depending on presence of other minerals, but typically white, grey, pink or red due to iron oxides.
